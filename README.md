Within this project I aim to explore the symbiotic relationship between gesture and sound. Gesture specifically emanant of the face. Emotions, linear gesture are all considered in the dsp implemented in this project; this data sonification excercise pulls from a corpus of segmentations, and will run individual grains through granular processing, vocoders and alot more.

## troubleshooting:

line 308 in the jsui object in the main tab of the patch may have to be commented out, 
more on this inside the patch.
